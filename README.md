# Portfolio_MC_Simulation
Analysis of Emergency Fund and Monte Carlo Simulations for investment portfolio

#### Files can be found in the Portfolio_MC_Simulation folder

Inside Portfolio_MC_Simulation you will find two .py libraries, MCForecastTools and MCForecastTools_fixed1. The original MCForecastTools contained an issue with how the Monte Carlo Simulations ran. The output of the MC functions used in the code returned a long list of warnings about inefficient data stacking. This was fixed in MCForecastTools_fixed1 and the new fixed library is used in the final product, financial-planner-copy.ipynb.

#### Inconsistencies between Canvas Instructions and Notebook Instructions
There were a few inconsistent instructions between the starter code and the Canvas instructions. Specifically, the number of shares of SPY in the portfolio is listed as 110 on Canvas but 50 in the starter code. I used 50. Next, there were some inconsistencies or unclear instructions regarding the optional challenges at the end of the HW. Specifically what weights to use for the analyses. Since we were planning for an early retirement, I went with an aggressive 80/20 split between stocks and bonds.
